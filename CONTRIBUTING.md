# Contributing Guidelines

As LLMs and AI agents are rapidly evolving, we welcome contributions to enhance the [AGENTS.md](/AGENTS.md) template. Whether you have suggestions for new sections, improvements to existing guidelines, or examples of successful implementations, your input is valuable. However, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing:

## General guidelines

- Do not add specific instructions for particular AI models unless they are universally applicable.
- Do not add specific instructions for a particular programming language or framework, we want this template to be as general as possible. We may create specialized versions later if this one gains traction.
- Make sure your contributions aren't too verbose; keep them concise and focused on practical improvements.
- Do not add separators `---` or `***` between sections, they are unnecessary and add noise.
- Provide clear explanations for your contributions, including the rationale behind them and how they improve AI agent behavior.
